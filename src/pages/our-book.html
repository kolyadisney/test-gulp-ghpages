I'm Flo, the author of this book and founder of Air360.<br><br>I wanted to make this book because most businesses do analytics wrong and even if they do it right, they don‚Äôt know how to use data for sustainable growth. If business growth is your biggest dilemma, this is the book for you ‚Äì read it.<br><br>Your business generates heaps of data on daily basis such as website visitors, their location, average session duration, bounce rate, CTAs clicked, pages visited, product purchased, subscribed to your newsletter, and so on. This data needs to be collected and analyzed for decision-making. Are you doing it? Do you have the right analytics tool to track data?<br><br>I bet you have but are you using data from your analytics tool for business growth? <strong>That‚Äôs where most businesses lack.</strong><br><br>They do all the hard work to collect data, generate reports, and tweak their campaigns but they rarely use it for growing their business.<br><br>This book will show you how to use data to grow your business irrespective of your industry. It covers everything that you need to know about data, analytics, and business growth. It unleashes a growth model and a step-by-step guide on how to practically do it.The book is packed with tons of examples to make it easier for the readers to understand and make sense of the models and techniques.If you‚Äôre struggling with data analytics or business growth or both, this book is for you. It will help you grow your business without spending any additional money.<br><br>You don‚Äôt have to create new marketing campaigns, you don‚Äôt have to run PPC ads, etc. rather it will show you how to use all the existing data that you already have to <strong>take your business to the next level</strong>.</p>
